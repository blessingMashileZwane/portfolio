# <strong>Gardening</strong>

## This began when I moved to a new home that has strawberries planted which instilled the idea of growing more vegetation, which is quite odd now seeing that I don't eat vegetables, but I have been able to grow potatoes, pumpkin, spring onions, aloe and avocado.

<br />

# <strong>Cooking</strong>

## With an increasing number of vegetation, I had to learn to utilise it in some way, now I can manage to cook a 3-course meal, which is quite delicious if friends and family are to be believed.

# <strong>Mechanic</strong>

## When you get stuck on the highway in the middle of nowhere, you start to realise that regardless of your insurance policies, knowledge of your car mechanics might be your saving factor, sometimes all you need is to slam an alternator with enough force and on you back on the road.

# <strong>Chess</strong>

## Started in 2014 when I needed something to do during high school recess, now I'm rated 16\*\* on chess.com.
